# Deep-Learning-Third-small-homework
The third small homework for the 'Deep learning a gyakorlatban Python és LUA alapon' course.

## The goal of the project
The main goal of this project was to successfully predict the weather in Budapest on some given days:
 - október 28.
 - november 3.
 - november 24.
## Solution
 I Tried to achieve this by creating a neural network with 3 dense layers.
### Dataset and Solution
 The dataset which I used to train, test and validate my network was provided by https://www.met.hu/en/eghajlat/magyarorszag_eghajlata/eghajlati_adatsorok/Budapest/adatok/napi_adatok/index.php
 website. 
 
 To be able to use my jupyter notebook it is necessary to download the budapest_weather_dataset_met_1901_2020.csv file and upload them into the notebook.
 
 The project had 3 main parts:
  1. Data collecting and cleaning
  2. Creating the neural network
  3. Test and make predictions
 
You can find my solution in 'DL_harmadik_kis_házi.ipynb' file.
